## About this fork

Luster is a credited fork of Photon Shaders, rebuilt to run well under Apple's OpenGL 4.1 compatibility profile. The sections below detail specific systems in this fork, verified directly against the shader source.

## Mac compatibility

Luster targets Apple's OpenGL 4.1 core profile specifically — the last OpenGL version macOS supports. This profile has no compute shaders and a hard 16-texture-unit sampler budget per shader stage, both meaningfully more restrictive than the OpenGL 4.3+/4.6 environments most shaderpacks (including upstream Photon) assume. Where upstream Photon logic would exceed the sampler budget or lean on compute-shader-only features, this fork reworks the pass to fit within Apple's constraints while preserving the visual result as closely as possible. This is the core reason this fork exists, distinct from any single feature listed below.

## Ambient occlusion (RTAO)

`SHADER_AO` in the settings menu selects between three ambient occlusion methods: `SHADER_AO_SSAO`, `SHADER_AO_GTAO`, and `SHADER_AO_RTAO`. RTAO is a screen-space ray-marched implementation — the ray-marching logic lives in `include/misc/raytracer.glsl` (function `raymarch_depth_buffer`), which intersects view-space rays against the depth buffer with a dither offset, a depth-tolerance check (credited to DrDesten), and a binary-search refinement pass. `RTAO_STEPS` (1–16) and `RTAO_RADIUS` (0.5–10.0) control ray count and reach.

## Image-based lighting (IBL)

`IBL` is a toggleable option with `IBL_SAMPLES` (4–32) controlling sample count and `IBL_INTENSITY` (0.00–2.00) controlling strength. This sits alongside direct sun/moon/block lighting as an ambient contribution term, feeding indirect diffuse lighting from the sky.

## Colored handheld lighting

`HANDHELD_LIGHTING_MODE` has three states: `HANDHELD_LIGHTING_OFF`, `HANDHELD_LIGHTING_NORMAL`, and `HANDHELD_LIGHTING_COLORED`. The colored mode extends held-item light sources (torches, lanterns, etc.) beyond a flat white/warm light to carry actual item-tinted color, with `HANDHELD_LIGHTING_INTENSITY` (0.00–2.00) controlling brightness.

## Moon phase influence

Moon phase affects lighting, atmosphere, and reflections independently, each with its own toggle and strength slider:

* `MOON_PHASE_NIGHT_LIGHTING` + `MOON_PHASE_LIGHTING_STRENGTH` — scales night-time direct lighting contribution by moon phase
* `MOON_PHASE_NIGHT_ATMOSPHERE` + `MOON_PHASE_ATMOSPHERE_STRENGTH` — scales atmospheric/sky brightness by moon phase
* `MOON_PHASE_REFLECTIONS` + `MOON_PHASE_REFLECTIONS_STRENGTH` — scales moonlight's contribution to specular reflections by moon phase

Splitting these three into independently toggleable systems (rather than one blanket moon-phase multiplier) means, for example, moon-phase-driven reflections can be tuned or disabled without affecting ambient night lighting.

## Distant blur

One of two Depth of Field modes, selected via `DOF_MODE`: `DOF_MODE_OFF`, `DOF_MODE_DOF` (true depth of field), or `DOF_MODE_DISTANCE_BLUR`. Distance blur softens geometry past a threshold distance rather than focusing around a focal plane — controlled by `DISTANT_BLUR_INTENSITY` (0.00–1.00) and `DISTANCE_BLUR_START` (1–256 blocks), useful as a cheaper, less DOF-like distance-fade effect.

## Fog smoothing

`FOG_SMOOTHING` with `FOG_SMOOTHING_RADIUS` (0.5–10.0) — smooths transitions in fog density/color, reducing banding or hard edges where fog volume boundaries would otherwise be visually abrupt.

## Everywhere Rain Puddles mode

When it rains rain puddles everywhere not actually a "puddle"

## GUI / settings organization

The settings menu is organized into topic-grouped screens (Materials, Reflections, Lighting, Clouds, Rain, IBL, etc.) rather than one flat option list — this groups the options documented above (RTAO, IBL, handheld lighting, moon phase, DOF/distance blur, fog smoothing) under their relevant categories so they're discoverable without scrolling a single long list. *(Note: exact screen names/groupings are best confirmed in-game via Iris's shader options menu — I've verified the underlying settings exist and are extensive, but haven't independently audited the menu's screen-by-screen layout.)*
